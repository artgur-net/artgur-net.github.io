There are fife following rules 

* S *SRP* Single responsibility principle
A class should have only a single responsibility (i.e. only one potential change in the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class)
* O *OCP* Open/closed principle
Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
* L *LSP* Liskov substitution principle
Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.
* I *ISP* Interface segregation principle
Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
* D *DIP* Dependency inversion principle
One should â€œDepend upon Abstractions. Do not depend upon concretions.


Another rules that not belongs to SOLID, but still worth to mention is KISS and DRY
