SOLID is a set of principles that helps you to keep your code more modular, more testable, and easier to extend. 

# List of principles 

There are fife following rules 

* S **SRP** Single responsibility principle

This mean if the one thing in specification is changed you need to change the code in the single place/class

* O **OCP** Open/closed principle

Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

* L **LSP** Liskov substitution principle
Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.
* I **ISP** Interface segregation principle
Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
* D **DIP** Dependency inversion principle
One should â€œDepend upon Abstractions. Do not depend upon concretions.

# The uncle Bob's example

Another rules that not belongs to SOLID, but still worth to mention is KISS and DRY
