The difficult attitude as I call it is quite curious, because people who are rude and treat others bad might also attract them. In this article I am going to describe this phenomenon.

Like MD house with his drugs, the trade make is an uneasy habit that makes everyone suffer from a little bit.

"If you face some problem that bothers you make others suffer from it even more"

Clever insults Politically inforrect and as much as possible an offensive language (insult of the day) 


Torvalds linus - find the quoute about stupid people 

(insult of the day)
